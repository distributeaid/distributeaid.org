          We offer a flat, per-pallet and per-box storage and shipment charge
          (S&amp;S) to take the stress out of budgeting to move your aid. By
          using the Staging Hubs we can keep shipping costs low and consistent,
          and spread the cost evenly for all groups sending aid.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          We've recently had to raise prices to match current economic
          conditions. However, we are applying for funding for upcoming
          shipments to help offset these. This funding will be applied evenly
          across all pallets on the shipment, so please do offer as much aid as
          you can and we'll confirm the final total before the drop-off date.

            We reserve 2 pallets worth of space on each truck for overflow, so

            You'll still need to book a Standard Pallet space for commercially
            purchased aid with smaller pallet dimensions. Unfortunately, due to
            the way trucks are packed a smaller pallet size doesn't actually
            allow us to fit more on there. You can always contact{' '}

          <li>
            We can book you multiple Standard Pallets worth of space to
            accommodate bulky items. Please submit the exact dimensions of the
            item on the offer form so we can assess how many Standard Pallets it
            will require, and ensure that we book a curtain-side truck to load
            it.
