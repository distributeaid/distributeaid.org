        About our mission
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are re-imagining humanitarian aid delivery. We aim to help move{' '}
        <strong>humanitarian aid</strong> to where it is needed most, create an{' '}
        <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>time-saving</strong> system for
        shipments of aid, and <strong>lower carbon emissions</strong> for
        humanitarian aid. Distribute Aid has the end goal of producing a
        platform for the use of aid collection and service providing groups that
        will incorporate all of these aims seamlessly. We offer support to a
        huge network of grassroots organisations working within the Refugee Aid
        movement in Europe, and COVID-19 response groups in Europe and the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distribute Aid wants to bring more transparency to all groups involved
        around what donations are on offer, and make it easier to see what is
        needed where, which also prevents waste. Creating a platform for aid
        delivery will connect hundreds of independent groups working in the same
        field, for the same greater cause but who currently have little
        oversight. This platform will also provide a way to collect data on
        regional needs, providing a wider overview of needs and assist in
        securing in-kind donations to a scale never before possible!
