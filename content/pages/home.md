  Distribute Aid delivers humanitarian aid to communities in need.

  By coordinating end-to-end shipments, we make it easy for donors to connect with frontline aid organisations, understand the needs on the ground, and get their aid delivered.

      'Distribute Aid helps European grassroots refugee aid groups support
      over 100,000 asylum seekers. We assist with every point in the supply chain: assessing
      needs, gathering supplies at home or from in-kind donors, coordinating shipments,
      and advising on distributions. We currently send several regular shipments each
      month to multiple destinations and handle specialty/emergency response shipments
      as well.'

    location: Europe & USA
    description:
      Distribute Aid is actively working to prevent the spread of COVID-19
      globally. We regularly send hygiene and PPE shipments to our European partners
      who continue to work to protect people in crowded refugee camps. Because COVID-19
      affects everybody, our response grew as the virus spread. We now also collaborate
      with multiple grassroots networks in the US to support their response.

      over 5 million items through our in-kind donor programme. Email [donate-aid@distributeaid.org](mailto:donate-aid@distributeaid.org

    description:
      Distribute Aid was officially invited to join Operation _Allies Welcome_
      at Fort Pickett in November. Our role on base is to manage all the donated aid.
      We work with NGOs and departments across the base to assess the needs of our guests,
      and work with the community of external organizations supporting the Operation
      _Allies Welcome_ mission to help facilitate aid deliveries. Once aid arrives on
      base we work with the US Marines to distribute items to guests, and supply materials
      for NGOs running education & activity programs to use in their classes. In November
      & December, our efforts resulted in more than 750,000 items being distributed
      to or used by 7,500 guests at Fort Pickett. You can support our work by [donating
      to us through our Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/fort-pickett)!
