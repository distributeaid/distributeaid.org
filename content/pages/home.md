  Distribute Aid delivers humanitarian aid to communities in need.

  By coordinating end-to-end shipments, we make it easy for donors to connect with frontline aid organisations, understand the needs on the ground, and get their aid delivered.
how_we_help_block:
- title: Refugee Aid
  location: Europe
  description: 'Distribute Aid helps European grassroots refugee aid groups support
    over 100,000 asylum seekers. We assist with every point in the supply chain: assessing
    needs, gathering supplies at home or from in-kind donors, coordinating shipments,
    and advising on distributions. We currently send several regular shipments each
    month to multiple destinations and handle specialty/emergency response shipments
    as well.'
- title: COVID-19 Response
  location: Europe & USA
  description: Distribute Aid is actively working to prevent the spread of COVID-19
    globally. We regularly send hygiene and PPE shipments to our European partners
    who continue to work to protect people in crowded refugee camps. Because COVID-19
    affects everybody, our response grew as the virus spread. We now also collaborate
    with multiple grassroots networks in the US to support their response.
- title: In-kind Donations
  location: Global
  description: Distribute Aid runs a successful in-kind donation programme where we
    connect companies with aid organisations. Through our network of hundreds of charities,
    we can handle coordinating large volumes of donations. To date, we have secured
    over 5 million items through our in-kind donor programme. Email [donate-aid@distributeaid.org](mailto:donate-aid@distributeaid.org
    "Contact Distribute Aid") if you can donate in-kind.
