  Distribute Aid delivers humanitarian aid to communities in need.

  By coordinating end-to-end shipments, we make it easy for donors to connect with frontline aid organisations, understand the needs on the ground, and get their aid delivered.

- title: Refugee Aid
  location: Europe
  description: 'Distribute Aid helps European grassroots refugee aid groups support
    over 100,000 asylum seekers. We assist with every point in the supply chain: assessing
    needs, gathering supplies at home or from in-kind donors, coordinating shipments,
    and advising on distributions. We currently send several regular shipments each
    month to multiple destinations and handle specialty/emergency response shipments
    as well.'
- title: COVID-19 Response
  location: Europe & USA
  description: Distribute Aid is actively working to prevent the spread of COVID-19
    globally. We regularly send hygiene and PPE shipments to our European partners
    who continue to work to protect people in crowded refugee camps. Because COVID-19
    affects everybody, our response grew as the virus spread. We now also collaborate
    with multiple grassroots networks in the US to support their response.
