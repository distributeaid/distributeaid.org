introduction: |-
  Distribute Aid is organising a shipment of humanitarian aid between the UK and Lebanon. We won't let pandemics or global supply chain disruptions stop the flow of aid to those who need it most! â™¥

  If you're here because you want to donate goods for displaced people in Lebanon- **thank you!** Groups on the ground would not be able to provide the services they do without support from donations like yours.
