introduction:
  "Distribute Aid is hoping to send a UK to Lebanon shipment around March.
  This is dependent on storage availability, the need in Lebanon, and the capacity
  of UK groups. Drop us an email if you would be interested at hubs@distributeaid.org
  with the subject line 'UK to Lebanon interest'. \n\nIf you're here because you want
  to donate goods for displaced people in Lebanon- **thank you!** Groups on the ground
  would not be able to provide the services they do without support from donations
  like yours. We won't let pandemics or global supply chain disruptions stop the flow
  of aid to those who need it most! â™¥"
