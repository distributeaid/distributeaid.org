    title: Aid Hubs and Regular Routes
    subtitle: Distribute Aid collects aid from multiple organisations at one central
      hub and then ships it with regularity, lowering shipping costs and increasing
      predictability for everyone involved.

      **The Problem It Solves**

      The grassroots aid network consists of a multitude of small independent groups that operate in varying environments and management frameworks. Although groups are extremely versatile and resilient, there are limitations that exist; including:

      * Limitations with the inter-communication and coordination between groups
      * Lack of information sharing
      * Inability to plan long-term
      * Difficulties in aid matching and sorting

      For a sector that is underfunded and overworked, the hubs model works to solve these inefficiencies.

      **How It Works**

      We set up hubs that function as community warehouses. These spaces are used for smaller groups to amalgamate aid in order to send a full truck or container full of aid. This system allows for organised aid matching and sorting, regular dispatches of humanitarian aid to frontline groups, and tariff free shipments into the EU.

      **The Benefits**

      * Distribute Aid can access commercial shipping, thus lowering shipping costs by up to 40%.
      * Aid matching, and enhanced sorting at hubs reduces waste in money, space, and CO2 emissions.
      * Offering all incoming donations to all grassroots groups in an area increases cooperation and coordination.
      * We run regular route shipments which allow for both sending and receiving groups to plan ahead, thus improving their services.

      **The Problem It Solves**

      There are places in the world with humanitarian organisations that need aid items to support their beneficiaries. Other places in the world have aid items to donate. The challenge is getting the aid to these “receiving groups” from those “sending groups.” Without logistics expertise, moving aid across international borders is difficult. Mistakes can be costly. Countries frequently change their regulations and requirements for tax-free import and export of humanitarian aid. Even among seasoned logisticians who are used to moving products around in a corporate setting, the ins and outs of humanitarian aid logistics can be hard to grasp.

      **How It Works**

      Distribute Aid is highly experienced at shipping humanitarian aid. We ensure we keep up to date with updates to countries’ import and export requirements. When a humanitarian organisation reaches out to us for help with transporting aid, we can offer them individual services or a complete logistics package: advising on where the aid is most needed, providing information about loading and unloading requirements, liaising with freight companies on behalf of the humanitarian group, coordinating deliveries to multiple end-receivers in the same region, filing all relevant customs paperwork, etc. We have a solidarity pricing model, meaning we organise shipments for grassroots organisations completely at-cost. Groups can rest easy knowing the logistics are handled, and they don’t have to pay anything extra for this peace of mind.

      **The Benefits**

      * Aid donations are impactful because we help senders allocate them where they are most needed.
      * Our shipping services are cost-efficient and timely because we work with a range of commercial shippers.
      * As long as groups provide accurate information about what’s on a shipment, they don’t need to worry about import and export compliance issues.
      * We ensure transparency in our communication with all of our partners.
    subtitle: Distribute Aid offers logistics expertise so that any humanitarian group
      seeking to move aid from one place to another can do it safely and efficiently.

    subtitle: Distribute Aid distributes large in-kind donations of new items across
      our network to the places they’re needed most, based on our needs assessment
      data.
    title: Distributing In-Kind Donations Across Our Network

      **The Problem it's Solving**

      Although community collection of items like used clothing is excellent for fulfilling many humanitarian needs, most of the aid that on-the-ground organisations require cannot be second-hand: soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, underwear, etc. One great source of new items is corporate in-kind donations of items, but grassroots organisations tend to operate at too small a scale for this to be a realistic option.

      **How it Works**

      Distribute Aid sources bulk donations from companies and manufacturers and distributes them across our network. Since DA can represent hundreds of grassroots organisations' interests, larger amounts of aid can enter the aid ecosystem. In other words, this is another way that we bring the benefits of large-scale operations to small- and medium-scale organisations.

      **The Benefits**

      * Grassroots organisations gain access to high-quality manufactured products.
      * Items that companies intend to incinerate or put in a landfill instead go to people who can use them.
      * Humanitarian organisations save money that they can use for other purposes since they don’t have to purchase as many new items.
      * The scope of who is involved in the humanitarian response grows as more companies get involved.
