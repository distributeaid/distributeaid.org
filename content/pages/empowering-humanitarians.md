    title: Freely Accessible Instructional Guides
    subtitle: Distribute Aid creates solutions to address complicated challenges and
      then publishes them in an open-source guide that anyone can access and use.

      **The Problem it’s Solving**

      In general, some challenges arise in humanitarian aid that require substantial time and expertise to solve. One example is Brexit: because the Brexit agreement was reached last minute, the movement of tax-free humanitarian aid across the UK-France border virtually ceased when Brexit happened. Another example is COVID-19: organisations supporting people on the move in Europe faced unique challenges in trying to carry out their work during a pandemic, with little official government public health guidance for their type of organisation.

      **How It Works**

      DA, either with our own expertise or the expertise of experts we get in touch with, solves the problem and publishes the solution in a freelly accessible guide. In the case of Brexit, this meant working with British customs to co-create the new process and paperwork for importing humanitarian aid tax-free from the United Kingdom to France. Our Brexit guide offers a step-by-step process for anyone to follow the process we co-created. In the case of COVID-19, this meant bringing together a group of health professionals to produce a guide about how on-the-ground organisations can fulfil their missions to support refugees and other disadvantaged people while responsibly managing the risks of the pandemic.

      **Benefits**

      * The solutions in our guides are freely available to everyone inside (or outside) the humanitarian aid movement.
      * Small, grassroots organisations can address problems they may not be able to solve otherwise.
      * In the case of the Brexit guide, the flow of aid from the UK to France resumed after we published the guide.
      * In the case of the COVID-19 guide, aid groups had a place to go to receive advice tailored to their circumstances.

    title: Encouraging Responsible Humanitarian Practices
    subtitle: Distribute Aid ensures that we are on the same page with organisations
      sending or receiving aid about ethical humanitarian norms through our memoranda
      of understanding (MOUs).

      **The Problem It’s Solving**

      One of our favourite aspects of grassroots humanitarian aid is the low barriers to entry: Anyone can get involved and make a difference! However, humanitarian aid can also involve a learning curve that takes time for new humanitarians and organisations to master. In particular, ethical norms of humanitarian conduct aren’t always obvious or self-evident. It can be challenging for people new to the movement to know where to look to learn about responsible participation in the humanitarian aid movement.

      **How it Works**

      Distribute Aid helps empower organisations and individual humanitarians to adhere to high ethical standards in their work. The key way we do this is through the memoranda of understanding that we sign with groups with which we work. These agreements help to make sure that aid will be used responsibly and distributed unconditionally. For example, we only ship aid to groups if they have a photo policy that protects the rights and privacy of beneficiaries; posting unblurred, personally identifiable photos (of children especially) poses real risks and should be avoided.

      **Benefits**

      * Distribute Aid encourages accountability and ethical practices in the aid network through our written MOUs.
      * The MOUs help to keep Distribute Aid accountable to our values, too!
      * If a person or organisation is new to the aid movement, our MOUs usually start a productive conversation about ethical practices, during which we thank them for getting involved and direct them to additional resources.

    title: Online Platform for Aid Networks
    subtitle: Distribute Aid is building an online platform to unify our network and
      many of our services in a one-stop shop.
    bodyText: |-
      **The Problem it’s Solving**

      Through our efforts and network-building to date, Distribute Aid has made many processes easier for humanitarians. This includes sourcing, placing, and shipping humanitarian aid; communicating and acting on humanitarian needs; solving complicated logistical challenges; and connecting with other humanitarian groups to engage in knowledge sharing. Still, these functions of DA operate as related but separate processes. There remains room for them to become integrated into one cohesive platform so that accessing these services is even easier and more accessible to humanitarians.

      **How It Works**

      Perhaps the easiest way to picture how the platform will work is to walk through an example aid shipment. Before the shipment is conceived, on-the-ground humanitarian groups fill out our needs assessment survey on our platform. A group in the UK has a large number of shoes to donate, so they go on DA’s platform and input “shoes.” The platform’s dynamic needs visualisations show which regions need shoes. The group formally submits an aid offer on the platform. Distribute Aid looks at the request and notifies the specific groups in the region(s) that expressed a need for shoes, as long as shipping to that group is practical. Distribute Aid arranges the shipment or refers the groups to other possible logistics providers. While the shipment is in transit, both sides can view updates in the platform’s shipment tracker. Once delivery occurs, both groups can view the shipment's statistics, including the value delivered to the end beneficiary, total human needs met, carbon emissions generated, etc.

      **Benefits**

      * Groups will have one easy place to perform various humanitarian aid logistics and knowledge-sharing activities.
      * Organisations will be able to view statistics about shipments to assist in their impact reporting and sustainability efforts.
      * Humanitarian needs will be viewable in the form of dynamic visualisations beyond what is currently available in our static PDF report.
      * Distribute Aid can roll out pieces of the platform over time to generate buy-in for its value and utility.
