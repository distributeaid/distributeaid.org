name: Croatia
overview: People typically cross Croatia to reach Slovenia - entering the Schengen
  zone, then continuing on to Austria, Germany, France and other countries in central
  and northern Europe. In 2022, [the number of migrants trying to enter Croatia has
  been steadily decreasing as migrants look for alternative routes to enter EU countries.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/croatia-bih-border-sees-a-decrease-in-illegal-migrants/)
  With such brutal government-led treatment of people on the move in Croatia, the
  need for grassroots groups is clear. Lack of official support and upholding of basic
  human rights means there are many ways in which grassroots can and need to support.

  making it one of the hardest transit points within the EU. However, following the
  announcement that the border fence between Slovenia and Croatia will be dismantled
  by the end of the year, this could redirect migration onto this route again. [Croatia

  at its borders for years. They are accused of illegal pushbacks, repeatedly denying
  the right to claim asylum including for families and minors. There are countless
  accounts of abuse including people being bound, brutally beaten and tortured. Human
  Rights Watch recently remarked that [“Croatia’s unlawful and violent summary returns
  of asylum seekers and migrants should disqualify it from joining the Schengen Area”](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/human-rights-watch-calls-on-eu-dont-let-croatia-join-schengen/)."
