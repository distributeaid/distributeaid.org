overview: People typically cross Croatia to reach Slovenia, then continuing on to
  Austria, Germany, France and other countries in central and northern Europe. In
  2022, [the number of migrants trying to enter Croatia has been steadily decreasing
  as migrants look for alternative routes to enter EU countries.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/croatia-bih-border-sees-a-decrease-in-illegal-migrants/)
  With such brutal government-led treatment of people on the move in Croatia, the
  need for grassroots groups is clear. Lack of official support and failure to uphold
  basic human rights means there are many ways grassroots can support people on the
  move. NFI, medical assistance, legal support, and much more are all vital services
  currently provided by non-profit groups in Croatia.

  at its borders for years. They are accused of illegal pushbacks, repeatedly denying
  the right to claim asylum, including for families and minors. Countless accounts
  of abuse include people being bound, brutally beaten and tortured. Human Rights
  Watch recently remarked that [“Croatia’s unlawful and violent summary returns of
  asylum seekers and migrants should disqualify it from joining the Schengen Area”](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/human-rights-watch-calls-on-eu-dont-let-croatia-join-schengen/)."
