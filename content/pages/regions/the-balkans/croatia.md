overview: People typically cross Croatia to reach Slovenia - entering the Schengen
  zone, then continuing on to Austria, Germany, France and other countries in central
  and northern Europe. In 2022, [the number of migrants trying to enter Croatia has
  been steadily decreasing as migrants look for alternative routes to enter EU countries.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/croatia-bih-border-sees-a-decrease-in-illegal-migrants/)
  With such brutal government-led treatment of people on the move in Croatia, the
  need for grassroots groups is clear. Lack of official support and upholding of basic

  the right to claim asylum including for families and minors. There are countless
  accounts of abuse including people being bound, brutally beaten and tortured. Human
  Rights Watch recently remarked that [“Croatia’s unlawful and violent summary returns
  of asylum seekers and migrants should disqualify it from joining the Schengen Area”](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/human-rights-watch-calls-on-eu-dont-let-croatia-join-schengen/)."
