    - title: EU Increases Use of Technology to Monitor Migration
      content:
        The EU is applying new high-tech measures to hinder people from crossing
        into the EU, including [technology tracking, biometric data gathering, and drone
        surveillance](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38478/digital-borders-eu-increases-use-of-technology-to-monitor-migration).
        This could lead to a decline in people migrating through these territories,
        choosing more dangerous routes, or taking greater risks on the existing Balkan
        route.

overview:
  The Balkan region borders the EU and Schengen zone, which makes it a standard
  route for transitory migrants wishing to gain asylum within the EU. The Balkans
  act as a transitory region for people on the move, most from Afghanistan, Pakistan,
  Syria, Iraq and Iran. Many transition through in hopes of gaining entrance to Croatia
  or Hungary, from where they can travel to other EU states. Since the infamous EU-Turkey
  deal closed the Balkan Route at the Greece-Turkey border, the Balkans have relatively
  low numbers of asylum applications. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia have around
  [5000 asylum seekers](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/southeasterneurope)
  while Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania have less than 200. However, [some
  60,000 people traveled along the Balkan route in 2021](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38478/digital-borders-eu-increases-use-of-technology-to-monitor-migration).
governmentResponse:
  'Most states are often antagonistic towards people seeking refuge
  in Europe. Since 2017, there has been a problem of pushbacks along the Croatian
  and Hungarian borders: people attempting to cross a border are forcibly ‘pushed
  back’ into the country they entered from by authorities. The practice often constitutes
  human rights violations, including [assault, gender-based violence, and violence
  against children](https://refugee-rights.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RRE_NoRightsInSight.pdf).
  Hungary is the only EU country to have formally legalised pushbacks nationally,
  although they are commonplace in many EU countries.'
