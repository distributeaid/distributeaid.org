  description: Accurate population numbers are hard to ascertain as people in The
    Balkans tend to be on the move.  Numbers can change substantially from season
    to season due to drastic temperature fluctuations, events in Greece, and other
    reasons. You can find the latest UNHCR Report [here]().

name: Bosnia
overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the last transit corridors used by people
  on the move (PoM) to reach the EU. [3,076 migrants and asylum-seekers arrived irregularly
  in BiH in August](https://reliefweb.int/report/bosnia-and-herzegovina/bosnia-and-herzegovina-operational-update-august-2022),
  representing a 47% increase since the previous month and a 78% increase compared
  to August 2021. Afghanistan and Burundi are the two largest nationalities represented
  among PoM in Bosnia. [Around 19% of PoM stay for less than two weeks, and 4% stay
  for 12 to 24 months before they continue their journey.](https://bih.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1076/files/documents/dtm_bih_14-round_report_21_07_2022_eng.pdf)
  Many travel by bus from Sarajevo to the northwest of Bosnia, to towns like Bihać
  and Velika Kladuša, before attempting to cross into Croatia.

governmentResponse: Although there are various reception centres, the vast majority
  of people stay in informal camps so as to avoid the overcrowding and inhumane conditions
  of the reception centres. In [September 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the
  EU Civil Protection Mechanism as a participating state](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_5343).
  Bosnia and Herzegovina was already benefiting from the EU Civil Protection Mechanism
  as a receiving country. Since early 2018, [the EU has provided €18,8 million in
  humanitarian aid directly to Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/where/europe/bosnia-and-herzegovina_en),
  yet problems in camps across the country remain. Food security is a major concern,
  and gaps in service provisions are glaring. Therefore, it is vital that grassroots
  groups receive the support they need from the international community in order to
  continue to fill these gaps.
