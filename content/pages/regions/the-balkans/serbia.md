overview: |-
  Most asylum seekers reach Serbia after traveling across Turkey, Greece, and Montenegro or Bosnia.  Hungary or Croatia are popular next steps, although most asylum seekers will usual travel on to other EU countries before making a claim.  The most popular time to attempt a border crossing is in the summer, when many people on the move will live in squats along the border while preparing to "go on game".

  The Serbian government runs a handful of refugee camps, most of which are located in isolated areas.  NGO access to these camps has been barred since the pandemic began.
