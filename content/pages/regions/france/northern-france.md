introduction: The number of displaced people in Northern France continuously fluctuates,
  as it hosts a transient community. Many people reach Northern France after months
  of travelling hoping to cross the channel to the UK. [Calais and the surrounding
  area host around 2,000 refugees](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/23/we-all-get-scared-migrants-in-calais-face-fear-determination),
  which will likely increase given the situation in Ukraine. In 2021, [an estimated
  35,382 people attempted to cross the English Channel](https://ecre.org/channel-crossings-soar-in-2021-with-no-legal-routes-fears-for-displaced-following-calais-funding-cut-warm-welcome-illusive-as-resettlement-flops/),
  almost three times as many as in 2020. This is likely due to other routes being
  closed or more difficult to access, rather than an overall increase in people seeking
  asylum. Many people making this journey speak English, have family or friends in
  the UK, and/or have been subject to state violence in other countries, deterring
  them from claiming asylum there.
governmentResponse: Displaced people in France face “[inhuman and degrading living
  conditions, as well as police abuse and harassment](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/france).”
  The state sometimes provides emergency shelter during particularly cold weather,
  but almost all migrants are forced to live outside in makeshift camps. Police minimise
  livable areas and frequently seize property. [Human Rights Observers witnessed at
  least 156 evictions in February alone, and roughly 627 tents and tarps were destroyed
  across Calais and Grande-Synthe.](https://humanrightsobservers.org/monthly-observations/)
  These evictions [regularly subject people to violence and police brutality](http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HRO-2020-Annual-Report_All.pdf).
populationTrend: Fluctuating, likely to increase. It is difficult to gather accurate
  data on the number of displaced people in Northern France. The population is largely
  on the move, and the French government continues to refuse support from the UN,
  so very few official statistics are collected.
populationDescription: The war in Ukraine has led many Ukrainian nationals to seek
  temporary refuge in Calais while attempting to seek asylum in the UK. As of March
  8th, [around 600 Ukrainian refugees are in Calais.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-60664557)

    There are typically the most people on the move in Northern France during the summer months, with the least during the winter.
