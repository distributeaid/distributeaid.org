overview: After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a lot of people had the intention of
  leaving the country to one of the bordering states. Long traffic jams in the cities
  and in the border regions grew as the conflict continued. The chaos was intensified
  as able men [were conscripted to the Ukrainian army](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/17/men-fighting-ukraine-separate-families/7077716001/)
  and families had to be separated. Reports of children going missing around the border
  regions are alarmingly high and human trafficking is a serious concern among the
  organisations working in these areas.

  According to estimates made by the [UN OCHA](https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/ukraine/#cf-7zDXryKIJX1IHL5zJL5YcA) as many as 18 million people across Ukraine are in need of assistance with water, sanitation, and hygiene. In the areas with little or no conflict, people are now starting to return to their homes. [More people are now returning](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40990/frontex-more-ukrainians-are-returning-than-leaving-the-country) to Ukraine than the number who are leaving. According to Frontex estimations made in early September, around 5.5 million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine.
