overview: |-
  Poland was one of the first countries to offer refuge for Ukrainian refugees after Russia’s invasion. As of September 2022, [1.4 million refugees have registered for temporary protection](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine/location/10781) and it is estimated that [just under 3 million Ukrainians have sought refuge in Poland](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) since the beginning of the conflict.

  The situation between the Polish and Belarusian border is still an ongoing crisis. In June 2022, a border wall standing [5.5-meter (18-foot) high along 186 kilometers (115 miles) of its northern frontier with Belarus](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-africa-poland-forests-middle-east-443c8068ea7b5d1d8f6980da6e3879af) was completed. The aim of the wall is to keep migrants out. On top of this, in October 2021, Poland introduced a new law, [attempting to legalise pushbacks](https://reliefweb.int/report/belarus/violence-and-pushbacks-poland-belarus-border). It permits Polish authorities to send back anyone who enters policing territory from Belarus. However, [these pushbacks are illegal according to international law](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/migration-and-asylum/common-european-asylum-system_en) and have involved several criminal acts of violence; [excessive force, extortion, torture and rape has occurred](https://reliefweb.int/report/belarus/violence-and-pushbacks-poland-belarus-border) in the border region.

  Polish authorities have been conducting violent pushbacks, the Belarusian authorities have been forcing the same people to cross the border by using violent means such as tasers and dogs. Since grassroots groups have been forbidden from entering the heavily policed border area the exact needs of the people who reside there is hard to know. However, it is believed medical supplies and shelter items are in high demand.
