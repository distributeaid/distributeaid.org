overview: 'As of 4 October, just over [851,000 refugees from Ukraine](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine)
  have entered Slovakia since Russia’s invasion. This is [the largest influx of refugees
  Slovakia](https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/dispatch-from-slovak-border-we-dont-understand-why-putin-is-doing-this-to-us/)
  has seen in its history. In a survey conducted by the [International Organisation
  for Migration](https://displacement.iom.int/reports/slovakia-displacement-surveys-ukrainian-refugees-and-third-country-nationals-09-march-11)
  (IOM), spanning from the 9th of March to the 11th of August, 1,298 refugees were
  interviewed regarding their needs and intentions. 84% of the interviewees were women
  or girls. '

governmentResponse: The highest needs for the people who arrived in the Slovakian
  reception centre were “information support” (71%), “financial support” (66%), “transportation
  support” (57%), and “food” (47%). These services are generally not provided by governments
  and have to be provided by the grassroots groups and citizens in Slovakia. Although
  there was an initial outpouring of public support and solidarity within Slovakia
  for Ukrainian refugees, [at least one survey suggests](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/23009378/slovaks-scepticism-towards-ukrainian-refugees-is-rising-survey-finds.html)
  that attitudes might be hardening.
