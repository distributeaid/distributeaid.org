overview: According to the UNHCR, over 1.7 million [Ukrainian refugees had entered
  Romania](https://reliefweb.int/report/romania/regional-refugee-response-plan-ukraine-situation-inter-agency-operational-update-romania-august-2022#:\~:text=Operational%20context,to%20remain%20in%20the%20country.)

  of [violent pushbacks](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/romania/report-romania/).
  Despite this, Romania is becoming [a more frequently used route](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32629/romania-poor-peoples-route-to-europe)
  for PoM. It is considerably easier to enter compared to either Croatia or Hungary
  if one travels from Serbia. Still, in comparison to other surrounding states, Romania
  may be easier to enter because it is not part of the Schengen area.  There have
  been [numerous reported instances of police brutality](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32629/romania-poor-peoples-route-to-europe),
  often resulting in bruises, fractures, and broken bones. [Romanian officials have
  on several occasions denied that any pushbacks](https://ecre.org/balkan-route-croatia-and-romania-deny-systemic-pushbacks-despite-overwhelming-evidence-ngos-point-to-eu-complicity-and-urge-stronger-response-croatian-border-monitoring-toothless/)
  or violent acts of police brutality have occurred despite the overwhelming evidence.
