overview: In Hungary, people on the move attempting to enter the country from the
  south on the Serbian-Hungarian border are facing harsh receptions from authorities.
  Grassroots groups have, on countless occasions, exposed the Hungarian local authorities
  of [sending dogs on, beating, and arresting people on the move](https://reliefweb.int/report/hungary/hungarys-pushbacks-non-ukrainian-asylum-seekers-akin-migratory-apartheid-enar).
  These types of mistreatment of people on the move have led to [Hungary being found
  guilty of inhuman treatment](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40960/european-court-of-human-rights-hungary-guilty-of-inhuman-treatment)
  by the European Court of Human Rights.

  Hungary first [built a fence along its border](https://asylumineurope.org/reports/country/hungary/asylum-procedure/access-procedure-and-registration/access-territory-and-push-backs/) with Serbia in 2015 in an attempt to prevent people on the move from crossing into Hungary on this route. Shortly after, it also installed [a small barbed wire fence](https://asylumineurope.org/reports/country/hungary/asylum-procedure/access-procedure-and-registration/access-territory-and-push-backs/) along its border with Croatia. Despite these efforts, data suggests [thousands of people still cross](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/despite-border-fence-hungary-is-route-hope-migrants-west-2022-02-18/) the border every year.

  Hungary opened the doors and allowed around [1.5M Ukrainians](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) to cross the border. However, it is important to note that Hungary has been [accused of inflating the number of admissions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/hungary-accused-of-inflating-number-of-ukrainian-arrivals-to-seek-eu-funds) by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee.
