    label: Humanitarian Needs in Ukraine - OCHA
name: Eastern Europe
map: "/uploads/eastern-europe.png"
overview: Eastern Europe as a region, includes Ukraine, Romania, Moldova, Hungary,
  Slovakia, and Poland.  It mostly act as places of transition for people wanting
  to seek asylum in other EU countries- although not always.  Since Russia's war in
  the Ukraine began, millions of Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries.

  Governance in this region has been characterised by right-wing populism, as seen in Hungary and Poland, which results in fewer rights for people on the move. Humanitarian aid organisations have been forced out of the region by government hostility, despite the critical need for medicine, warm clothing, and shelter. Construction of a $353 million fence along half the border is underway, adding to the growing anti-immigration EU policies often referred to as “[Fortress Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/01/the-guardian-view-on-fortress-europe-a-continent-losing-its-moral-compass)_”_. Romania, one of the transitory countries for people travelling from the southeast into the EU, [has the largest number of illegal pushbacks recorded by UNHCR](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32629/romania-poor-peoples-route-to-europe).

  Eastern European countries have been much more welcoming to Ukrainian refugees than those fleeing conflict in the Middle East or North Africa.
