regionName: Greece
overview: |-
  There are two core areas on the Greek mainland where NGOs are based, Thessaloniki and Athens. In the north of Greece, in Thessaloniki, displaced people may [seek permanent residence or prepare to travel further west](https://www.refugeesintowns.org/thessaloniki). Athens is most commonly where people are moved to from the Aegean Islands after their asylum applications have been processed. Recently, people have been transferred off the Greek islands while their asylum cases are still being processed. Some people seek permanent residence in Athens while others only stay until arrangements are made for resettlement elsewhere in Europe.

  The Aegean Islands are a group of small Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, located just a few kilometres west of Turkey. Their close proximity to the Turkish coast makes them a destination for many people seeking safety in Europe. However, smugglers have employed life-threatening and money-saving tactics, such as using unsuitable boats, providing insufficient fuel to complete the crossing, fake or no lifejackets, and sending boats despite poor sea conditions.

  "Greece has been moving towards a US-style detention and deportation
  system. Greece recently took over responsibility for making cash support payments
  to asylum seekers from the UNHCR, but tethered it to detention and cut large numbers
  of recipients from receiving aid.

  build camps on Samos, Kos and Leros is completed. Plans remain to build closed facilities
  on Lesvos and Chios. Humanitarians have concerns about camp conditions: access to
  education for children, sufficient services to be provided to the residents, for
  human rights observation, or for the freedoms of asylum seekers e.g. to come and
  go.\n\n  \nIn both cities and surrounding areas, there are some formal camps, as
  well as people living in squats, apartments, or without any shelter. The camps on
  the mainland are following the trends seen on the Aegean Islands, with [high concrete
  walls being built around them](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32834/greece-migrant-camps-surrounded-by-concrete-walls),
  echoing the detention centre style of accommodation. The living conditions in the
  detention centres are often deplorable. In Eleonas, close to Athens, overcrowding
  and low maintenance are significant issues. As the registration procedure gets stricter
  many are told that they are not “vulnerable enough” for shelter, food, or monetary
  aid."
