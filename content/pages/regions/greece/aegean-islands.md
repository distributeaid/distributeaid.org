introduction:
  The Aegean Islands are a group of small Greek islands in the Aegean
  Sea, located just a few kilometres west of Turkey. Their close proximity to the
  Turkish coast makes them a destination for many people seeking safety in Europe.
  However, smugglers have employed life-threatening and money-saving tactics, such
  as using unsuitable boats, providing insufficient fuel to complete the crossing,
  fake or no lifejackets, and sending boats despite poor sea conditions.
governmentResponse:
  'Greece has been moving towards a US-style detention and deportation
  system. Greece recently took over responsibility for making cash support payments
  to asylum seekers from the UNHCR, but tethered it to detention and cut large numbers
  of recipients from receiving aid. This is [creating a human rights](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621307/bp-detention-as-default-greece-asylum-161121-en.pdf;jsessionid=E395A5C0804B9A94EBA2F1D7907AC19F?sequence=1)

  education for children, sufficient services to be provided to the residents, for
  human rights observation, or for the freedoms of asylum seekers e.g. to come and
  go.'
