name: Southern Greece
overview: |-
  The refugee solidarity response in Southern Greece is centered around Athens, which is most commonly where people are moved to from the Aegean Islands after their asylum applications have been processed. Some people seek permanent residence in Athens while others only stay until arrangements are made for resettlement elsewhere in Europe.  It is common for refugees to live on the streets for periods of time, especially in the summer.

  There are many community-led projects in Athens, including informal schools, free shops, street food / services, social centers, and squats.  However, warehousing is very expensive in the city so most larger hubs are located at the edges or in nearby towns.  Refugee camps are located in smaller towns surrounding the city.
