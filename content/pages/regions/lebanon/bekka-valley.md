    39% of total registered refugees in Lebanon](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/71).
    [80% of refugees have no legal residency](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/news-stories/stories/syrian-refugees-lebanon-between-hammer-and-anvil_en),
    making it difficult to calculate how many refugees currently reside in the country.

overview: |-
  [Around a quarter of Syrian refugees are located in Bekaa Valley](https://reporting.unhcr.org/document/2972). The Lebanese government does not permit large camps, and as a result, informal, small, makeshift camps without essential services are commonplace. The region is one of the most economically deprived; it is common for [children to be taken out of school so they can go into full-time work to support their families](https://www.thenationalnews.com/weekend/2022/09/09/syrian-refugees-forced-to-choose-between-school-or-work-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley/).

  Recently, the power supply in camps across the Bekaa Valley (specifically Arsal) [is frequently suspended due to the rise in the price of mazout (fuel oil)](https://diyaruna.com/en_GB/articles/cnmi_di/features/2022/03/29/feature-01). The shutdown of generators profoundly affects the lives of displaced people. Darkness prevents children from being able to access remote learning, spoils food in refrigerators, prevents the provision of medical services, and gives rise to crime.
