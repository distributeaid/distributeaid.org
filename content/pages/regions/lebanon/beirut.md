  description: Beirut has various refugee camps that have existed since the late 1940â€™s.
    Over time they have become established towns/neighbourhoods, [home to thousands
    of Palestinian and Syrian refugees. The largest camp hosts over 100,000 individuals
    and families.](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon) Despite refugee communities
    residing in areas for decades, they are marginalised from the local Lebanese community.
    [Most people do not own Lebanese identity documents, their movements are restricted
    by law, and they cannot not access healthcare, own their own land, or work in
    certain professions](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/56cc95484.pdf). As the dire
    situation in Lebanon continues, displaced people are those most affected, often
    living in desperate conditions with little hope of change.

overview: The accumulation of crises in Lebanon, specifically Beirut, has led to enormous
  difficulties across many levels of society. People living in Beirut have been affected
  by the COVID-19 pandemic, electricity shortages, fuel shortages, medicine shortages,
  massive inflation, and the [port blast in August of](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/lebanon)
  2020, which left 300,000 people without shelter. These factors have resulted in
  significant numbers of people falling below the poverty line across all parts of
  society. As Beirut hosts a large array of Lebanese families, refugees, and foreign
  workers from many backgrounds, these intersecting crises are affecting the entire
  population in Beirut to varying degrees.
