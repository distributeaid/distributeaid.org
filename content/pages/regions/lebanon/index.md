overview:
  Lebanon's largest population of refugees is in Bekaa, which hosts[ 39% of
  total registered refugees](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/71).
  The lowest population is in South Lebanon, with [90,832 registered refugees.](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/71)
  Since many do not get registered, the actual number is likely much higher. Lebanon,
  once an upper-middle-income country, is entering its third year of severe economic,
  political and social crises. [**1.5 million refugees**](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2022/1/18/Syrian-refugees-Lebanon-help-protection-pressure-leave)
  are at particular risk. Their rights and freedoms, economic opportunities, and relations
  with host communities have deteriorated amid wide-felt poverty and hardship.

  "Experiencing a massive decrease in international and national
  funding for refugees, the Lebanese government [has yet to propose a long-term and
  viable plan](https://apnews.com/article/business-middle-east-lebanon-beirut-hezbollah-6fba3e7874b69381d194a029f51bda49)
  to improve the situation for refugees and Lebanese citizens struggling to make ends
  meet. Government restrictions increasing the risk of deportation mean fewer people
  register as refugees, further isolating them from support systems. [**A 2019 government
  decision**](https://www.nrc.no/news/2022/february/lebanon-syrian-refugees-face-evictions-as-they-take-desperate-measures-to-survive-the-winter/)
  preventing settlements from becoming permanent shelters has led to the systematic
  destruction of homes.\n\n[1 million Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters across
  2,000 communities](https://www.concernusa.org/story/largest-refugee-crises/). Economic
  insecurity in Lebanon has resulted in[ 9 out of 10 Syrian refugees falling into
  extreme poverty](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/news-stories/stories/syrian-refugees-lebanon-between-hammer-and-anvil_en).
  The lack of legal residency creates barriers to jobs and essential services such
  as education and healthcare, leaving refugees vulnerable to exploitation, eviction
  and deportation.  \n  \nTODO: bit about the beirut blast displacing lebanese poeple,
  and the general economic crisis affecting lebanese people as well"
