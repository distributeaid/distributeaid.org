    text: |-
      Open Source Explorers is [Distribute Aid’s](https://distributeaid.org) open source outreach program. It uses contributions to Distribute Aid’s projects as a well-structured and impactful introduction to open source. The program is aimed at developers, designers, and other types of contributors. It lasts 3 months, is part-time, and a volunteer engagement.

      Program participants will be paired with mentors and collaborate with each other in teams and with existing Distribute Aid team members.
