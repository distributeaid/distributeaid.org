    title: Needs Assessments
    subtitle: Distribute Aid regularly surveys frontline groups to understand humanitarian
      needs across our aid network. We communicate our findings to the broader aid
      movement.

      **The Problem it's Solving**

      It is difficult for those seeking to donate aid to discern the needs of beneficiaries on the ground hundreds or thousands of kilometres away. It’s impractical for them to speak to tens of organisations to understand the bigger picture of humanitarian needs in a particular region. Additionally, Distribute Aid’s aid matching system is more effective when we have a macro- and micro-level understanding of our partners’ humanitarian needs.

      **How it Works**

      Every quarter we collect survey data from groups that provide humanitarian aid and services across Europe and Lebanon to understand their needs for the following three months. We identify which support they're lacking and which items they have in oversupply. We compile the information into a public report and include up-to-date contextual overviews for each region of operation. We also use the detailed data internally to support our aid matching and logistics services. This Needs Assessment survey can easily be repurposed for other aid responses around the world.

      **The Benefits**

      * Distribute Aid and other humanitarian organisations can ensure that aid shipped is appropriately tailored to the needs of beneficiaries.
      * When we learn that two organisations in the same region have complementary surpluses and needs, we organise mutually beneficial aid swaps.
      * Our public report gives a large-scale picture of the needs across the grassroots humanitarian aid movement that is broader than any one region or organisation.
      * Our public report offers powerful visualisations that reveal the scope of governmental failure to meet basic human needs and the scale of the grassroots aid sector working to meet those needs.

    title: Matching Aid to Needs
    subtitle: 'Distribute Aid considers on-the-ground humanitarian needs in everything
      we do: if we know an item is unneeded at its destination, we don’t ship it. '

      **The Problem It’s Solving**

      When organisations and individuals make the generous decision to donate humanitarian aid, they have to decide what to send and where to send it. They might do a community collection and then try to send all of the items they collect. They may rely on heuristics like “I know that I would like receiving this item, so recipients of humanitarian aid likely would, too.” However, the needs of beneficiaries may look very different from those of donors. Without a solid commitment to focusing on beneficiaries' real, demonstrated needs, it is possible to ship aid based on what is available rather than what is needed.

      **How it Works**

      Distribute Aid uses our knowledge and organisational relationships to ensure that we do not send an aid item unless we know people on the receiving end need it. On our regular route shipments, this works like online shopping; sending groups indicate which items they have available, and receiving groups receive only the aid they put in their “cart.” On our ad hoc shipments, receiving groups only accept a shipment when they are satisfied with its potential to fulfil the needs of their beneficiaries. When we are offered an in-kind donation, we only distribute it across our network if we know it’s needed. Our needs assessment data underpins all three of these processes.

      **The Benefits**

      * Aid delivered to frontline groups is targeted to their needs.
      * Frontline groups can spend less energy sorting, storing, or disposing of items that aren’t needed when they’re received (storage space can be tight–and expensive!).
      * Aid donors can have peace of mind that their donations will be put to good use.

      The groups that are most proximate to beneficiaries determine what aid gets shipped to support those same beneficiaries.

      **The Problem It’s Solving**

      The humanitarian aid scene contains a large number of diverse organisations doing amazing work across the globe. Collaboration among organisations with similar aims, strategies, or beneficiary populations can be highly fruitful. However, it’s difficult for any organisation to find the time to reach out to a bunch of other groups! Even if they have time, it’s not always obvious where to look. Group leaders are often unaware of possibilities for collaboration that might exist.

      **How it Works**

      Distribute Aid’s network contains hundreds of organisations, including many grassroots aid groups. We frequently have new groups reach out to us via email or social media. When we realise that two groups might benefit from collaborating, we offer to connect them. They might swap knowledge about aid shipments, humanitarian best practices, funding opportunities, key contacts to be in touch with, collaborate on bulk-purchasing, and many other topics.

      **The Benefits**

      * There is a great deal of learned wisdom in humanitarian communities that they can share far and wide.
      * Collaboration leads to outcomes that can’t be achieved alone.
      * Even when Distribute Aid can’t be of assistance to an organisation that reaches out to us, we can connect them to other groups that might be able to help.
      * Aid groups can discover opportunities for collaboration without spending too much time searching.
