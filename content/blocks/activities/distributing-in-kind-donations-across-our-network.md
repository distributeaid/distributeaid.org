title: Distributing In-Kind Donations Across Our Network
desc: Distribute Aid uses distributes large in-kind donations of new items across
  our network to the place where they’re needed most, based on our needs assessment
  data.
challenge: Much of the needed aid required by service providing groups has to be new
  and not second-hand; such as soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, underwear, etc. These
  are the items that are most sought after and those least available, which leads
  to aid groups struggling to keep essential services running. Since grassroots organisations
  usually operate at a smaller scale, it is not possible for them to handle the volume
  of donations a manufacturer would want to donate to make it worth their time.
explanation: Our In-Kind Donations Programme sources bulk donations from companies
  and manufacturers and distribute them within the grassroots aid network. Since DA
  can represent hundreds of grassroots organisations' interests, larger amounts of
  aid can enter the aid ecosystem.
benefits: |-
  * Gives small, grassroots organisations access to high-quality manufactured products.
  * Gives use to items that would otherwise go to waste or landfill.
  * Provides service-providing groups with bulk amounts of much-needed items.
