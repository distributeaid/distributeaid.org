title: Ad Hoc Shipping
desc: Distribute Aid offers logistics expertise so that any humanitarian group seeking
  to move aid from one place to another can do it safely, cheaply, and efficiently.
challenge: Small grassroots organisations who have sourced aid do not have the capacity
  or connections to organise cross-border shipments. In addition, aid donating groups
  do not have sufficient information on where their donations are most needed and
  can have the greatest impact.
explanation: Due to our large network of contacts and continuous needs assessments,
  we can ensure that donations sent through us are allocated to those groups that
  need it most. We can also coordinate deliveries to several end-receivers in the
  same region, to ensure efficiency in shipping and make sure all items go to immediate
  use. Distribute Aid offers a full service to grassroots organisations and corporations
  wishing to donate in-kind to coordinate entire shipments from the moment of pick-up
  to final delivery. Our expertise allows Distribute Aid to ship at competitive prices
  within efficient time-scales.
