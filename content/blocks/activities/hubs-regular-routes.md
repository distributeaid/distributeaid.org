title: Aid Hubs and Regular Routes
desc: Distribute Aid collects aid from multiple organisations at one central hub and
  then ships it with regularity, lowering shipping costs and increasing predictability
  for everyone involved.
challenge: |-
  The grassroots aid network consists of a multitude of small independent groups that operate in varying environments and management frameworks. Although groups are extremely versatile and resilient, there are limitations that exist; including:

  * Limitations with the inter-communication and coordination between groups
  * Lack of information sharing
  * Inability to plan long-term
  * Difficulties in aid matching and sorting

  For a sector that is underfunded and overworked, the hubs model works to solve these inefficiencies.
explanation: We set up hubs that function as community warehouses. These spaces are
  used for smaller groups to amalgamate aid in order to send a full truck or container
  full of aid. This system allows for organised aid matching and sorting, regular
  dispatches of humanitarian aid to frontline groups, and tariff free shipments into
  the EU.
benefits: |-
  * Distribute Aid can access commercial shipping, thus lowering shipping costs by up to 40%.
  * Aid matching, and enhanced sorting at hubs reduces waste in money, space, and CO2 emissions.
  * Offering all incoming donations to all grassroots groups in an area increases cooperation and coordination.
  * We run regular route shipments which allow for both sending and receiving groups to plan ahead, thus improving their services.
